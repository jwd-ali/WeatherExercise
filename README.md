Weather Mobile exercise project lets you fetch weather data from darksky Api

This test project is written in easily-extendable architecture (MVVM) and is built with Xcode and written entirely in Latest Swift 5 and Latest iOS 13. All Userinterfaces are build programatically for better reusability. I have used respository layer which decides either we need to fetch data from service layer or to get stored data. Due to lack of time i didnot attempt coredata to store respository feed if i get extra time i will do that ... In that case respository helped to decide.I tried to implement all SOILID principles in this assignment. Also attempt DarkMode to get bonus marks as well :). All model used in controller are segregated and implemented dependency inversion principle
